object FizzBuzzExercise extends App {
  //TODO print a sequence on a screen of the following type
  // 1,2,3,4,Fizz,6, Buzz, 8, 9, Fizz, 11,....34, FizzBuzz, 36, ..., 99, Fizz
  //so the rules are if number divides by 5 and 7 print FizzBuzz
  //if divides by 5 print Fizz
  //if divides by 7 print Buzz
  //otherwise we print the number itself

  //so this exercise tests your ability to write conditionals and also to write a simple loop

  //this exercise is the first screener at an interview to see if a person can program
  //for the first time it is okay to print the results in new line each
  //1
  //2 and so on
  //99
  //Fizz
